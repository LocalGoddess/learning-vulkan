# Chloe Learns Vulkan

Welcome to my repository where I learn Vulkan.

There are three branches:
- `initial-learning-branch`: my first attempt at learning Vulkan. Its written all in Rust and in one file.
- `structured-learning-branch`: my second attempt at learning Vulkan. Also written in Rust, but separated into different files.
- `c-learning-branch`: my third attempt at learning Vulkan. This time, written in C because I'm not to fond of existing Vulkan bindings in Rust.

The code in this repository obviously isn't the best Vulkan, Rust, or C code because I'm learning. I would much rather focus on writing speed than on code quality.

Thanks for reading! ðŸ’œ
