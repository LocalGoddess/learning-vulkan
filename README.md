# Learning Vulkan

This repo is the journey of me learning Vulkan in rust with winit and ash

# This Branch
This branch contains the first ever time I touched Vulkan code and is sloppy since I just wanted to learn the API and didn't care about structure. 
Currently I am working on a branch that will structure this code better for debug, and readablility sake.

Currently this branch can render a triangle to the framebuffer presented on a winit window. The window is rendered entirely using shader files and 
doesn't use vertex or index buffers because implemented those would cause this file to be even more bloat (its already 1,000 lines). Any way have fun
viewing this repository and stuff
